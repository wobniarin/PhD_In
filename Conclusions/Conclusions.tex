    %Introduction to the general conclusions  
    The increase of the electricity consumption in certain time periods, combined with the increase of DERs in distribution networks has made power systems to engage innovation and become active agents throughout the entire supply chain. Distribution networks are developing grid active management activities to mitigate and avoid congestion, and activating demand-side flexibility can be one of them. 
    This thesis gathers several studies related to flexibility services, and each chapter outlines specific conclusions based on the results. Despite, the present chapter exposes the main conclusions of the thesis, summarizes the main contributions and draw further research required for the resolution of remaining questions. 

\section{General conclusions}
The importance of lowering the carbon footprint of the electricity producion and engaging end-users to change their electricity consumption patterns while keeping the system reliability and the quality and security of supply has provided a revolution in the way distribution networks where managed until now. The raise of the flexibility concept has unlocked new business models and products for all the power systems agents, from the generation to the demand-side.

The work presented in this manuscript aims to provide some light on the flexibility concept, covering different points in the supply chain, such as the role in the already existing as well as the new energy markets, the definition of flexibility, the environmental impact of the current electricity production and the role of flexibility there, as well as how this flexibility can be forecast and how distribution network oprators can quantify the flexibility needed to mitigate congestions in their networks, providing an answer to the main research question of this work. 

Flexibility has lacked for many years of a clear definition of how it can be integrated in a local energy market, connecting flexibility providers and flexibility users. the initial research question $(i)$, wanted to outline and analyze all the possible market schemes for energy and flexibilty. The conducted research presented how these markets have been defined in the literature, how these services have been implemented and what were the market mechanisms for it. The studie provides a clear definition based on all the previous literature for the most important concepts like local market, energy, flexibility, as well as all the market agents present in this chain. One of the most important agents for the success of flexibility in distribution networks is the aggregator. The aggregator has the role to manage the demand-side flexibility and provide this flexibility to the final client. 

Once the market structure is clear, it is of clear importance to have a clear definition for flexibility, not only as a general concept, but considering important aspects for modeling and calculating the available flexibility. This work has been done under research question $(ii)$. There is still an unclear definition for flexibility and how to model it, and the work developed in this case provided a new framework for modeling flexibility, based on the end-user providing flexibility, the final client using this flexibility, the time horizon when this flexibility should be provided and the approach. There are two different approaches found when defining flexibility: the market-oriented approach and the system-oriented approach. The first adds a price to the flexibility signal, making it suitable for those scenarios where the flexibility is defined as a relationship between demand and price, considering the price and demand elasticity and controling the demand-side flexibility based on price. On the other hand, it is highlighted that the system-oriented approach does not include the price in the flexibility signal, but there is a cost of the flexibility activation, which has to be aggreed beforehand between the two parties participating in the flexibility supply. 

The latter flexibility definition is the one found most suitable for providing flexibility to the DSO, and also it becomes a more realistic approach due to the lack of control groups where demand changes can be monitored based on price signals. This leads to research question $(iii)$, where the main objective was to develop a framework for forecasting flexibility based on an agrgegator's portfolio. The main conclusions drawn from this research question in general terms are that even though there is the feeling that lots of data are being collected, there is still a lack of standarization of the data storage coming from smart meters, making it more difficult to handle and provide useful solutions. On top of that, there is still an unclear answer to how end-users data can be monetized, and as a result there is a lack of shared data in the energy field, difficulting the implementation of data-driven approaches for demand-side flexibility. Furthemore, there is a controversial issue that has arisen iwhen answering this research question, that is the importance of respecting the privacy of the end-user data, and ensuring that data-driven companies that base their business models in the data collected can still participate in open-data initiatives and share their data sources while respecting their intellectual property. Hence, aggregators and DSOs are different entities with different business models and as a fact there is not full cooperation in terms of data sharing. Besides, the current EU regulation states that DSOs and aggregators must be different entities. This is why the research performed under this research question aimed to provide a framework for forecasting flexibility in an aggregated way, ensuring that all the previous concerns are considered. Furthermore, this approach is not sensible to the portfolio size, since all the submetering data covering the flexibility signals is aggregated before calculating the forecast, being more suitable than aggregating single-users flexibility forecast afterwards. This tool provides aggregators with a solution for knowing with a limited amount of data and in a quick approach the amount of flexibility available within their portfolio for operation purposes. 

The flexibility forecast provides the answer to research question $(iii)$, computing the flexibility the aggregator has available in the portfolio. However, this flexibility is to provide a congestion management solution to the distribution network operator, instead of reinforcing the network. This relates to research question $(iv)$, where the objective is to provide a solution for DSOs to calculate their flexibility request in a cost-effective way, in a specific location of the network, ensuring that the power flow equations are respected. The main conclusion drawn is that it is possible to provide DSOs with a tool for calculating the operational flexibility needed to avoid or mitigate congestions in a MV network. However, it is clear that there is still a lack of knowledge of the overall network costs, so as to define a cost model for the DSO-flexibility. This is still a pending question, being important for the success of the flexibility provision to DSOs. 

This research, even though is focused in the flexibility interaction between end-users, aggregators and DSOs, this entire scenario should help towards the objective of the energy transition and the Paris Agreement. This is why there is a research question $(v)$, focused on the sustainability of flexibility. To do so, the current electricity production is enviromentally assessed by using one of the most known and used methodology, the life-cycle assessment. However, regular LCA approaches consider the average value of electricity production, not being able to cope and compute the environmental impact during peak-hours, being the time periods where flexibilit has its greatest potential. In this case, a new methodology is proposed, so as to calculate the environmental impacts in this time-periods. One of the conclusions drawn is that current CO$_2$ monitoring systems presents in the dashboards of the transmission system operators of the wholesale market operator for renewable energy sources only compute their value based on statistical analysis, concluding that all kind of renewable energy sources and distributed energy resources have an environmental impact of 0 kg CO$_2$/kWh, while the LCA approach proves that this is not true, and that when assessing the benefits of DERs the entire life-cycle should be considered. Furthermore, the current installed capacity is of a great importance, since the integration of DERs and RES sources could increase the environmental impacts on such cases. As a general conclusion, is not only a matter of integrating innovative solutions for developing smart grids, but also assessingt the benefits and the impacts of such technologies, to make sure the sustainability goals are respected. 

In summary, the integration of flexibility into the current power system is already a fact, being technically, environmentally and economically possible, as well as a business opportunity for many of the agents in the power system. There are strong interactions between all the agents, the market and the environment that have to be considered in all steps of the flexibility provision supply chain to succeed in the roadmap towards a low carbon power system.
