\section{Introduction}
One of the outcomes of the previous chapter is that flexibility can be a key enabler of the energy transition, due to the possibility to create a new service for network operators, aggregators, retailers and end-users. Even though in the first years of the discussion on local markets energy was the main product to be provided, reviewed literature showed an increasing interest on enabling flexibility. However, there is still some discussion on how flexibility can be defined, modeled, forecast and priced. This chapter focuses on the definition of flexibility according to objective $(ii)$ of the PhD research, and provides a formulation which will be later used for providing this service to the distribution system operator in Chapter 4. The relationship between the thesis objective within the whole ecosystem of the research is shown in Figure \ref{fig:chapter_obj_ii}.

The previous chapter highlighted the role of active grid management implemented by DSOs in order to increase the hosting capacity (HC) of distribution networks, and that flexibility could be one of the main services to achieve it. Furthermore, the provision of local flexibility will help not only to secure the grid operation but also to improve grid efficiency efficiency during normal operation time [18]. For these reasons, improved flexibility markets are being recognized in the e-Directive as a pillar to support the safer and more efficient use of the existing grids, and to enhance the HC of distribution feeders. Since the scope of this work is to research those regulations that enhance RESs penetration while guaranteeing safe operation of the power grid, it is interesting to study how flexibility markets could be designed in order to promote DERs participation.

\section{Flexibility definition}
The electricity system has one intrinsic flaw; the generation-consumption link which, aside from Energy Storage Sytems (ESS), is not breakable and in the energy transition new paradigm supposes a big challenge for the grid operators in terms of system safety. From a time-perspective this problematic has two sides, according to \cite{FINON2008143}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Long-term reliability (Capacity adequacy)}: The ability of the electric system to supply the aggregated electrical demand and energy requirements of costumers at all times.  \cite{FINON2008143}
\item \textbf{Short-term reliability (Flexibility)}: The ability of the electric system to withstand sudden disturbances.
\end{enumerate}

This can be considered as the initial and most generic definition of flexibility. However, in the recent years more specific definitions of flexibility have been provided, based on the final client using or providing it. These are given below:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Consumer approach}: From the consumer point of view, flexibility is meant to be the modification of generation and consumption patterns, employing DSM, in reaction to an external signal such as a change in price, to provide a service within the energy system \cite{OfficeofGasandElectricityMarketsOfgem2015}. They also include as new flexibility methods energy storage and distributed generation.
\item \textbf{Transmission system approach}: From the Transmission System Operator (TSO) perspective, it is understood as the capability of the power system to cope with the short and mid-term variability of renewable generation and demand so that the system is kept in balance \cite{Profumo2016, EuropeanNetworkofTransmissionSystemOperatorsforElectricityENTSO}.
The Universal Smart Energy Framework (USEF) points out that TSOs can benefit from flexibility services to cope with different problematic: from ancillary services for balancing purposes to constraint management and adequacy services \cite{USEF2018}.
\item \textbf{Distribution system approach}: Lastly, flexibility services for the DSO are related to the capability of the distribution network to cope with located short-term congestion of feeders, and also for distribution grid balancing purposes \cite{Minniti_2018, Khatami2018}. 
\end{enumerate}

To sum up, it is inherent to all the perspectives seen that flexibility is something that provides margin to the grid to maintain instantaneous stable and safe operation, and in some cases during normal operation periods it can improve the way the grid is working.


\section{Flexibility provision by the Demand-Side}
One way to approach the power system is by dividing it into generation and consumption, two antagonist concepts that are nowadays merging due to DERs and ESSs. Both sides can provide flexibility: Generation-side flexibility and demand-side flexibility. 

The new DG and Smart Grid paradigm turn the spotlight towards the DR concept. Hitherto, it was only provided by large loads with the ability to modify their consumption habits. From now on, DRwill be enhanced by the technological advances and the introduction ofDGatMVand LV level. In this newparadigm, even prosumers will be able to adapt their load profiles towards the grid. However, the Generation-Side Flexibility will still be a key agent on the flexibility markets. Demand-side Management can be approached from two perspectives defined in \cite{USEF2018}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Explicit Demand-Side Flexibility: "Dispatchable flexibility that can be traded (similar to generation
flexibility) on the different energy markets (wholesale, balancing, system support and reserves
markets). This is usually facilitated and managed by an aggregator that may be an independent
service provider or a supplier."
\item Implicit Demand-Side Flexibility: "Consumer's reaction to price signals. Where consumers
can choose hourly or shorter-term market pricing, reflecting variability on the market and the network,
they can adapt their behavior to save on energy expenses. This type of Demand-Side Flexibility
(DSF) is often referred to as "price-based" DSF."
\end{itemize}

While both kinds of DR are considered in the new European framework, Explicit Demand-Side
flexibility, together with Generation-side flexibility, are the ones towards the EU is legislating.
This is mostly because of their product nature that makes them market sellable, which supposes
a step forward on the predictions of capacity balancing of future power grids. At the same time,
if consumers can provide services to the grid operators, this will suppose empowerment for
them and possibly a push for the widespread of small RES installations.

\section{EU Guidelines and Legislation on Flexibility}
There are several approaches to add flexibility to the grid; the following list enumerates them and evaluates them from the prosumer perspective: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compulsory provision: Technical and operational requirements for all the generators and
loads is the traditional approach before the creation of the European balancing markets.
It is still a thing today on some legislations, but mainly for large PGMs. Imposing these requirements
to the smaller generators/loads nowadays seems technically impossible due to
the impossibility to control and monitor all the assets, plus it may be unfair for prosumers,
and could collide with their interests.
\item Bilateral contracts: TSO agrees with some capacity provider on an over-the-counter contract
to acquire capacity provision. These kinds of contracts are long-term ones, and the
capacity provided is well over anything a prosumer can provide. It is the least transparent
way to provide flexibility, but it can be a way to provide safety to some significant
investments focused on earning money from energy/capacity provision.
\item Flexibility provision by TSO or DSO: DSO and TSO as responsible for the grid management
may seem to be one of the prominent agents interested in flexibility provision.
However, due to the objectives of market liberalization and unbundling of the power grid
settled by the EU, DSOs and TSOs shall not be allowed to own either PGMs or ESSs (other
than justified exemptions; see section 4.3.1). Summarizing, this leads to the impossibility
of the system operators to provide such services
\item Flexiblity Markets: Since the publication of the First Energy Package, the creation of an
European internal electricity market has been the main objective. From this perspective,
nowadays the EU is promoting the use of flexibility markets as the primary capacity mechanism
(e-Regulation Art. 22), and also the creation of a standardized portfolio of products
to enhance the transnational exchange of capacity. The main argument to discourage other
options is that Europe as a whole is nowadays in over-capacity, and traditional capacity
mechanisms tend to be highly inefficient [19, 27, 35].
\end{enumerate}

The Third Energy Package follows the path established by the EU in terms of the creation of an internal European market, promoting the unbundling of the electric system structures and therefore opening the system to private investors. Then, there was the Energy Efficiency Directive (2012/27/EC), which is the first one to look forward to the use of "leveled-for-all-users" energy flexibility markets as the primary agents for the transformation to a more efficient energy system on the Article 18. Lately, the publication of the Electricity Balancing Guidelines (EB GL; 2017/2195) has been an enormous step forward in terms of standardization of balancing products and guidelines for MSs to establish their own balancing markets. Finally, the publication of the CEP outcomes is a new boost for flexibility markets, amending problematic not treated in previous directives and facing new challenges.  
However, it is important to consider that up until the CEP publication, when Europe was talking about flexibility markets it was focused on ancillary services related to frequency provision. This kind of product aims to balance generation and demand so TSOs centrally operate this market. Recently in the e-Directive (Art.59), the need for network codes related to non-frequency ancillary services is stated for the first time. This will suppose the opening of a new, but also unexplored, decentralized market for congestion management at DSO level.


\section{Service interaction}
In this PhD research the aggregator is responsible of scheduling all flexible assets according to different lower-level objective functions and flexibility contracts. \ref{fig:agg-pros-dso}

\section{Mathematical formulation for flexibility definition}
Hence, firstly, flexibility can be defined by determining the provider of this flexibility and the final user of these services. Based on that, flexibility can therefore be formulated under a market-oriented approach or under a system-oriented approach. From the market-oriented perspective, the most common definition of flexibility is determining operating points of flexibility, as defined in \cite{Olivella-Rosell2018}, or by specifying an upward and downward flexibility band, as stated in \cite{Soares2017}. Another approach for calculating the flexibility from the market perspective is modeling the elasticity between price and demand \cite{Gorria2013}, linking the price with the flexibility activation, represented as a consumption increase or decrease. From the system-oriented approach, flexibility has mainly been defined as a multiperiod and time-constrained vector, without an associated price to it, as described in \cite{Pinto2017}.
