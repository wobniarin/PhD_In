 \textbf{Storytelling PhD}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item What is the current situation?
 \begin{itemize}
	\item  Energy Transition - Clean Energy Package
	\item Increase on electricity consumption
	\item decomissioning of nuclear power plants
	\item Importance on society awareness on sustainability, as well as prices in some countries for access to electricity - What is our current carbon footprint?
  \end{itemize}
  
 \item What are the problems that we identify?
	\begin{itemize}
	\item some of the solutions for the energy transition can lead to congestion in distribution networks, due to the placement of DERs in MV and LV networks. 
	\item Are we sure that DERs are completely sustainable? Are we really sure that smart grids are completely sustainable, in each and every country? 
	\end{itemize}	 
 
 \item Possible solutions
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Enhance the development of carbon-free technologies by implementing sustainable solutions - Assessment of the environmental impact of electricity production by means of LCA to help in the development of energy policies and planning, as well as including LCA in end-user optimization for achieving lower carbon footprints. 
 \item Deployment of demand-side flexibility services by means of end-users flexible assets. 
 \end{itemize}
 \item Thesis contributions
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item Assessment tool for evaluating the environmental impact of electricity markets using hourly LCA, by means of Life Cycle Assessment
 	\item Definition of Flexibility: Characterization, modeling, implementation and evaluation
 	\item Possible use cases of demand-side flexibility: Flexibility services for DSOs. 
 \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
