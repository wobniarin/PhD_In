@article{IPCC2018,
abstract = {Under climate change, many species are increasingly exposed to heatwaves, including marine species. Although marine species are expected to succumb to heatwaves, there is increasing interest in understanding why some can persist. As heatwaves can greatly elevate intertidal seawater temperature, we explore reasons for variation in biological performance to acute thermal stress among three species of intertidal gastropods. When thermal refuges were unavailable for adaptive behavior, we show that their biological performance (feeding rate) was either maintained (resistant), recovered from a decline (resilient), or collapsed (sensitive), depending on the strength of molecular defense (where resistant species > resilient species > sensitive species). The integration of molecular, physiological, and behavioral responses within a species illustrates the kind of adaptive capacity that allows organisms to survive heatwaves and maintain their ecological functions. In this era of unprecedented environmental change, understanding how organisms persist seems as important as understanding how organisms perish.},

@article{Giannelos2016,
abstract = {Under the current EU legislation, Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) are expected to provide firm connections to new DG, whose penetration is set to increase worldwide creating the need for significant investments to enhance network capacity. However, the uncertainty around the magnitude, location and timing of future DG capacity renders planners unable to accurately determine in advance where network violations may occur. Hence, conventional network reinforcements run the risk of asset stranding, leading to increased integration costs. A novel stochastic planning model is proposed that includes generalized formulations for investment in conventional and smart grid assets such as Demand-Side Response (DSR), Coordinated Voltage Control (CVC) and Soft Open Point (SOP) allowing the quantification of their option value. We also show that deterministic planning approaches may underestimate or completely ignore smart technologies.},
