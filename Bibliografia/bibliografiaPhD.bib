@article{Roques2017,
abstract = {The policy objectives of decarbonisation of the electricity sector whilst maintaining security of supply have led to a new wave of market reforms in many jurisdictions which liberalised their industry. There is a wide range of models under this new hybrid regime which essentially combine the energy market with planning and long-term risk transfer arrangements. This paper takes an institutionalist approach in terms of modularity of the market design, and reviews the issues with the standard historical market model which led to the introduction of additional long term “modules”. We then study the interactions between the existing and new “modules” and identify ways in which the initial market modules can be improved to address inconsistencies with the new modules. We conclude by discussing the conditions under which the various changes in market architectures could converge toward a hybrid regime structured around a “two step competition”, with a “competition for the market” via the auctioning of long-term contracts to support investment, followed by “competition in the market” for short term system optimisation via the energy market.},

@article{Khan2019GHGreview,
	abstract = {Globally, electricity systems are responsible for two-thirds of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This area has become one of the main focuses for a wide range of scientific communities, and a large number of articles have been published that reported GHG emissions from the electricity sector using different approaches. Even though some review articles have been published on particular GHG emissions approaches, such as life cycle assessment (LCA), studies that investigated overall approaches are much rarer. A scoping review of these GHG emissions accounting approaches has thus been conducted in this study to explore their limitations and indicate possible future scope. From the review, it was found that the majority of the studies considered the LCA approach to investigate GHG emissions from electricity systems. Although the time-varying carbon intensity approach has potential features, it has received less attention. Furthermore, this review has highlighted some issues that need to be addressed by any new or existing approach that would deal with GHG emissions accounting in the near future. In addition, this review would be helpful for policymakers and electricity authorities when selecting appropriate approaches in accounting GHG emissions from the electricity system.},

@article{Khan2019CarbonIntensity,
	abstract = {In order to overcome the negative effects of climate change and ensure a global low-carbon future, decarbonizing the electricity sector has been recognized as an important focus area. Internationally, policymakers use average carbon intensity (in gCO2-e/kWh) in calculating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the electricity system. However, average carbon intensity is a single rate and a fixed quantity; thus, it does not provide any information about the time-varying nature of carbon intensity. The focus of this paper is to show the usefulness of time-varying carbon intensity estimation, which can provide detailed insights into GHG emissions, and help in identifying potential emission cut opportunities from the electricity sector in order to lessen atmospheric pollution. Time-varying carbon intensity estimation (i) reveals temporal variability of carbon intensity, (ii) explores the interplay between generations and emissions, (iii) identifies peak carbon-intensive hours, and (iv) provides evidence for designing appropriate demand-side management strategies with respect to GHG emission reduction.},

This paper analyses the impact of foresight towards decarbonization targets on the investment decisions in the European electricity sector using a specific model developed by the authors called dynELMOD. Incorporating the climate targets makes the investment into any additional fossil capacity uneconomic from 2025 onwards, resulting in a coal and natural gas phase-out in the 2040s. Limited foresight thus results in stranded investments of fossil capacities in the 2020s. Using a CO2 budgetary approach, on the other hand, leads to an even sharper emission reduction in the early periods before 2030, reducing overall costs. We also find that renewables carry the major burden of decarbonization; nuclear power (3rd or 4th generation) is unable to compete with other fuels and will, therefore, be phased out over time."

The first is a Regions scenario, whereby regions are modelled independently, and the second is an Area scenario, which has transmission interconnections between regions. Modelling is performed in hourly resolution for 5-year time intervals, from 2015 to 2050, and considers current capacities and ages of power plants, as well as projected increases in future electricity demands. Results of the optimisation suggest that the levelised cost of electricity could fall from the current 69 €/MWh to 56 €/MWh in the Regions scenario and 51 €/MWh in the Area scenario through the adoption of low cost, flexible RE generation and energy storage. Further savings can result from increasing transmission interconnections by a factor of approximately four. This suggests that there is merit in further development of a European Energy Union, one that provides clear governance at a European level, but allows for development that is appropriate for regional contexts. This is the essence of a SuperSmart approach. A 100% RE energy system for Europe is economically competitive, technologically feasible, and consistent with targets of the Paris Agreement."

abstract = "We present a computationally-efficient optimization model that finds the least-cost generation unit expansion, commitment, and dispatch plan to serve hourly electricity demand and ancillary service requirements. We apply the model to a case study based on data from the electricity market in Texas (ERCOT) to analyze the market and investment impacts of several incentive mechanisms that support variable renewable energy (VRE) investments and carbon emission reductions. In contrast to many previous studies, the model determines least-cost VRE investments under different cost and incentive assumptions rather than analyzing scenarios where VRE expansion is pre-determined. We find that electricity prices can vary significantly under different incentive mechanisms, even when comparable generation portfolios result. Therefore, the preferred incentive mechanism depends on stakeholder objectives as well as the prevailing electricity market framework. Our results indicate that a carbon tax is more system cost-efficient for reducing emissions, while production and investment tax credits are more system cost-efficient for increasing VRE investments. Similarly, incentive mechanisms that reduce electricity prices may increase the need for separate revenue sufficiency mechanisms (e.g. a capacity market) more than a policy that increases electricity prices. Moreover, the impacts on consumer payments are not always aligned with changes in system costs. Overall, the analysis illustrates the importance of considering electricity market impacts in assessing the economic efficiency of VRE and carbon incentive mechanisms."

We find that countries that price carbon emissions have gone on to adopt more solar and wind energy. The aggregate level of policy support, measured in euros per megawatt hour, appears to have been important for solar energy adoption. We also find that solar energy adoption has been larger in countries with higher proportions of people concerned about climate change. In addition, we assess the effects of other key explanators including financial system size and income levels."

In this paper, we forecast the future energy consumption structure through estimating the short and long-run relationship between economic growth, carbon intensity and consumption of coal, crude oil and natural gas, respectively. Using time series data and employing the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds test and Granger causality test based on Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), the results show that there are positive elasticities of coal, oil and natural gas consumption with respect to GDP and carbon intensity in long run. The Granger causality results indicate that there is a set of unidirectional and bidirectional causality among the selected time series. The future energy consumption structure is predicted using above models with assumed scenarios of GDP and carbon intensity. We find that both the GDP and carbon intensity will decrease when we reach the expected energy consumption structure by the governments. This suggests that the government should consider the adverse effects of reducing carbon intensity on economic growth and make appropriate policy on adjusting energy structure."

abstract = "Sustainable development requires methods and tools to measure and compare the environmental impacts of human activities for the provision of goods and services (both of which are summarized under the term “products”). Environmental impacts include those from emissions into the environment and through the consumption of resources, as well as other interventions (e.g., land use) associated with providing products that occur when extracting resources, producing materials, manufacturing the products, during consumption/use, and at the products' end-of-life (collection/sorting, reuse, recycling, waste disposal). These emissions and consumptions contribute to a wide range of impacts, such as climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, tropospheric ozone (smog) creation, eutrophication, acidification, toxicological stress on human health and ecosystems, the depletion of resources, water use, land use, and noise—among others. A clear need, therefore, exists to be proactive and to provide complimentary insights, apart from current regulatory practices, to help reduce such impacts. Practitioners and researchers from many domains come together in life cycle assessment (LCA) to calculate indicators of the aforementioned potential environmental impacts that are linked to products—supporting the identification of opportunities for pollution prevention and reductions in resource consumption while taking the entire product life cycle into consideration. This paper, part 1 in a series of two, introduces the LCA framework and procedure, outlines how to define and model a product's life cycle, and provides an overview of available methods and tools for tabulating and compiling associated emissions and resource consumption data in a life cycle inventory (LCI). It also discusses the application of LCA in industry and policy making. The second paper, by Pennington et al. (Environ. Int. 2003, in press), highlights the key features, summarises available approaches, and outlines the key challenges of assessing the aforementioned inventory data in terms of contributions to environmental impacts (life cycle impact assessment, LCIA)."

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a general description of local flexibility markets as a market-based management mechanism for aggregators. The high penetration of distributed energy resources introduces new flexibility services like prosumer or community self-balancing, congestion management and time-of-use optimization. This work is focused on the flexibility framework to enable multiple participants to compete for selling or buying flexibility. In this framework, the aggregator acts as a local market operator and supervises flexibility transactions of the local energy community. Local market participation is voluntary. Potential flexibility stakeholders are the distribution system operator, the balance responsible party and end-users themselves. Flexibility is sold by means of loads, generators, storage units and electric vehicles. Finally, this paper presents needed interactions between all local market stakeholders, the corresponding inputs and outputs of local market operation algorithms from participants and a case study to highlight the application of the local flexibility market in three scenarios. The local market framework could postpone grid upgrades, reduce energy costs and increase distribution grids' hosting capacity.},

Data from 2010 to 2016 for a panel of 20 European Union countries were used. Two models were estimated using both Panel-Corrected Standard Errors and Driscoll-Kraay estimators with fixed effects. These estimators were robust in the presence of cross-section dependence, first-order serial correlation and heteroscedasticity. The main results suggest that renewable electricity generation and the penetration of battery electric vehicles into the automotive market are helping to decrease peak electricity demand. At the same time, it was confirmed that employment in this industry sector is increasing peak electricity demand. The existence of peak periods was shown to be the main barrier to the integration of renewables into electricity systems. It seems that policies focused on Demand Side Management have been effective in integrating renewables in contrast to their lack of success in reducing peak electricity demand."

The main results as follows: (1) CO2 emission from electricity generation has increased from 530.96Mt in 1991 to 2393.02Mt in 2009, following an annual growth rate of 8.72%. Coal products is the main fuel type for thermal power generation, which accounts for more than 90% CO2 emissions from electricity generation. (2) This paper also presents CO2 emissions factor of electricity consumption, which help calculate CO2 emission from final electricity consumption. (3) In China, the economic activity effect is the most important contributor to increase CO2 emissions from electricity generation, but the electricity generation efficiency effect plays the dominant role in decreasing CO2 emissions."

@article{GDPR2,
abstract = {The integration of distributed renewable resources relies increasingly on ‘smart' solutions, requiring data to schedule, control and plan the operation of distributed assets within future energy systems. Such data can include household and even personal information. Personal location data can give valuable insights with relevance for energy consumption. Movement patterns and occupancy states help with scheduling of appliances, heating loads or storage, and other applications may yet emerge. Many smart home business models rely on data for their service provision. The potential upsides from the use of personal location data are met with growing concerns over information privacy. We present results from a representative UK survey on attitudes towards location data sharing. Our findings suggest that many of the resulting service benefits are widely appreciated. However, trust in the organisations delivering them is low and may inhibit their uptake. Less than 20{\%} of people are were willing to share their location data with an energy utility. In addition, the sense of control over location data appears low. Only 15{\%} claim to understand who had access to their location data and 70{\%} of participants feel that these settings are outside their control. These findings pose challenges for policy and regulation of data access. We make policy recommendations that seek to ensure smart solutions are not inhibited by a lack of public trust. In some cases this may require default settings that better match public expectations of data sharing defaults.},

 abstract = {By means of a real application, it is seen how ARIMA forecasts can be improved when nonlinearities are present. The autocorrelation function (ACF) of the squared residuals provides a convenient tool to check the linearity assumption. Once nonlinearity has been detected, parsimonious bilinear processes seem rather adequate to model it. The detection of nonlinearity and the forecast improvement appear to be rather robust with respect to changes in the linear and bilinear specification. Finally, what bilinear models seem to capture are periods of atypical behavior or sequences of outliers.},
