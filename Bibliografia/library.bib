abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art in voltage source HVDC at the present time. HVDC is introduced from its initial historical development, the introduction of line-commutated HVDC to present voltagesource HVDC designs. Converter control and coordination is discussed as are multi-terminal control and the need for DC breakers to facilitate such multi-terminal systems. Developments in DC breakers are reviewed. The importance of reliability, particularly of the cable, is highlighted and the issues surrounding cable modelling are briefly discussed. A summary of VSC-HVDC installations, both underway and planned, is given.},

abstract = {For many, the supergrid is seen as the solution that allows the massive integration of renewable energy sources in the European power system. It connects different remote energy sources to the existing grid while offering additional control. It offers balancing through geographic spread and allows a more diversified energy portfolio. In the meanwhile it increases the security of supply. However, technical limitations exist, and it is not yet possible to construct such a supergrid. Several outstanding issues need to be solved. This paper first describes the potential and need for a supergrid. The paper focuses on a meshed, multi-terminal VSC HVDC, and it is explained why this relatively new technology is believed to be the best suitable one for such a grid. The different difficulties or challenges that still exist are addressed. Not only the remaining technical limitations are addressed, but also the techno-economic, control and operational issues are discussed, as well as some regulatory obstacles.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE. This paper develops a flexible DC transmission system (FDCTS) to power control and load flow control within the multi-terminal (MTDC) grids. The FDCTS include static power electronics-based elements for electric energy transmission inside a DC grid. Considering the current advancements in the field of power electronics, this paper proposes a cascaded power flow controller (CPFC) as the first element of the FDTCS for providing power control in MTDC grids. It is shown through dynamic simulations that the CPFC is able to control power flowing through a particular DC transmission line, and thus enhancing controllability in the MTDC grids.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an m-port converter structure for high-voltage dc (HVDC) applications to facilitate power flow routing between k controlled dc busses and m-k independent dc networks. Power flow control is achieved via the injection of incremental dc voltages between the networks, thus the converter structure is only rated for a fraction of the rated power and voltage of the connecting dc networks. Unlike previously proposed dc power flow devices, these incremental dc voltages are generated without requiring power exchange with an external ac network. There are four variants of the structure, each offering unique advantages for deployment. These variants, and the modules that comprise them, are presented. An example simulation case-study is performed to demonstrate three-port bidirectional power flow control between networks of similar voltage (495/500/505 kV). The proposed converter structure is shown to route power between the networks using modules with MVA ratings approximately 2{\%} of the transmitted power. Thus, the proposed converter structure offers a highly cost-effective means of routing and controlling dc power flows within emerging HVDC grids.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016.The generation of offshore wind power is less predictable. This can cause the overload of offshore DC transmission system and thus requires the curtailment of wind power. To reduce the amount of wind power curtailment, a method of optimising DC power flow using DC power flow controller (DC-PFC) is proposed. The analytical expression of coordinating DC-PFCs and converters in controlling the power flow of the DC system has been created. Method has been developed to optimise the power flow of DC grids within which control setting changes automatically in different wind conditions to reduce both the power curtailment and power losses. The proposed method has been demonstrated and validated on a 9-port DC system. It is concluded that both the curtailment of wind power and power losses are effectively reduced by inserting DC-PFCs into DC grids.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.Background: Antidepressant-induced liver injury is a major concern and a liver monitoring scheme has been recommended by the European Medicines Agency for agomelatine. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the liver safety and identify the characteristics of patients who developed a significant increase in transaminases whilst taking agomelatine. Method: A retrospective pooled analysis of changes in transaminase levels in 9234 patients treated with agomelatine (25 or 50 mg/day; n = 7605) or placebo (n = 1629) from 49 phase II and III studies was undertaken. A significant increase in transaminase levels was defined as an increase to {\textgreater}3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) ({\textgreater}3 Ã— ULN). Final causality was determined in a case-by-case review by five academic experts. Results: Serum transaminases increased to {\textgreater}3 Ã— ULN in 1.3 and 2.5 {\%} of patients treated with 25 and 50 mg of agomelatine, respectively, compared with 0.5 {\%} for placebo. The onset of increased transaminases occurred before 12 weeks in 64 {\%} of patients. The median time to recovery (to â‰¤2 Ã— ULN) was 14 days following treatment withdrawal. Liver function tests recovered in 36.1 {\%} of patients despite continuation of agomelatine, suggesting the presence of a liver adaptive mechanism. No cases of acute liver failure or fatal outcome occurred. Patients with elevated transaminases at baseline, secondary to obesity/fatty liver disease, had an equally increased risk of developing further elevations of transaminases with agomelatine and placebo. Conclusion: Incidence of abnormal transaminases was low and dose dependent. No specific population was identified regarding potential risk factors. Withdrawal of agomelatine led to rapid recovery, and some patients exhibited an adaptive phenomenon. Overall, in clinical trials, the liver profile of agomelatine seems safe when serum transaminases are monitored.},

The tapping station allows to integrate wind power resources without building a new HVDC link and it is based on a Current Source Converter (CSC). However, the CSC requires a minimum DC current to extract the power coming from the OWPP which may not be guaranteed depending on the power conditions of the HVDC corridor. For this reason, this paper proposes a coordinated operation and control of the CSC and the OWPP. A steady-state analysis is performed to determine the appropriate AC voltage level of the CSC. A power reduction algorithm is presented to limit power extraction during a reduction in the current of the HVDC transmission system and under loss of communications between the CSC and the OWPP. The proposed algorithm and the performance of the system are validated through simulation results.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Two key problems in meshed high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission grids are managing line power flows and protection against dc faults. Current flow controllers (CFCs) will be required to balance cable currents in meshed dc grids, in order to prevent individual line power capacity limits restricting overall power flow in the grid. Direct current circuit breakers (DCCBs) will be also required to protect HVDC grids from dc faults. This paper demonstrates that the current flow controller functionality can be added into a hybrid CB's design. This paper proposes integrating an interline CFC into the load commutation switch (LCS) of a hybrid DCCB. The integrated design LCS/CFC is analyzed and a state-space model is derived. The control of the CFC is designed and the performance of the LCS/CFC during normal operation is verified by means of MATLAB Simulink and PSCAD simulations. A comparison of the integrated LCS/CFC and the separate design is given. The case studies show a reduction in total power losses, and improved protection operation times can be achieved.},

The HPFC, as one of the devices of the FDCTS, has a hybrid connection scheme (i.e. series-parallel) to the grid and allows power flow control through DC transmission lines by imposing a series voltage to the controlled DC line. In this work, in order to demonstrate the eligibilities of the HPFC, the performance of this device is included in the DC power flow formulation for the power flow control purposes.

The addition of the DC-PFC to the future Multi-Terminal HVDC (MT-HVDC) grids arises some key concerns such as stability, system interoperability, and possible adverse interactions. Hence, a suitable model is necessary to conduct deep frequency domain analysis. In this context, this paper proposes a linearized model for small-signal stability analysis of flexible MT-HVDC grids in state space framework that can be straightforwardly utilized in the process of control design. In this paper, a spick-and-span, systematic and step-by-step process to derive the small signal model of all flexible MT-HVDC grid components is presented such that each sub-system is modeled individually and then all are integrated together. The derived model is cross-verified by time domain simulations of a nonlinear system model in a MATLAB/SIMULINK platform for CIGRE DCS3 MT-HVDC test grid. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {â€”Inside the meshed LVDC distribution grids the power flow is predominantly limited by the line impedances. In order to achieve economical and flexible operation of the meshed LVDC distribution grids, it is required to control the power flow. For that end, the line impedances need to be adjustable. The line impedance can be controlled by a DC-DC transformer, however, it needs to be rated for the full grid power. In order to reduce the installation costs, a partially rated device is desirable. Therefore, a partially rated power flow control converter (PFCC) is proposed. This paper presents the PFCC performance estimate and demonstrates the PFCC functionality. The PFCC is an economical solution for increasing the controllability of the power flow in the meshed LVDC distribution grids. However, due to high step down ratio inside the PFCC achieving efficient performance is challenging. Furthermore, due to unavoidable MOSFET paralleling the part count rises. The proposed PFCC consists of two cascaded converters, therefore the control range and stability depends, besides else, on the impedance interaction between the two stages.},

The dc-dc converter employed in this paper is connected in cascade with the dc transmission line, and is therefore named Cascaded Power Flow Controller (CPFC). In this study, a two-layer control strategy is developed for the operation and control of Voltage Source Converter (VSC) stations and CPFC station in MTDC grids. At the primary control layer, a novel differential voltage droop control is developed, while at the secondary control layer, a modified dc power flow algorithmâ€”employing the new CPFC frameworkâ€”is implemented. The overall control strategy enables the CPFC to regulate the power flow in the dc transmission line. The primary control guarantees the transient stability of the CPFC, and the secondary control system ensures the desired steady-state operation. Proposed voltage droop control helps the MTDC grid to remain stable in the event of a communication failure between the primary and secondary control layers. Static analysis and dynamic simulations are performed on the CIGRE B4 dc grid test system, in order to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control framework for power flow regulation in MTDC grids.

It can be realized through the control of converter station's output voltage when one of the branches is over limit and need to be adjusted or must regulate the power flow to follow some dispatch orders. However, in the meshed DC grid, this adjustment will also significantly change the power flow of the other branches. This paper presents a new approach that series a converter into the branch which is under control. By changing the DC side voltage of the converter to regulate the voltage difference between the two ends of the branch, only the specific branch's power flow will be changed remarkably, and there will just have a little change in the other branches. In this paper, several DC power flow control devices which had been proposed were analyzed through works and operating characteristics, and then the feasibility of the series voltage source was verified through the simulation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE. The current route of achieving the ultimate plan for flawless operation and control of the multi-terminal DC (MTDC) grids can be significantly accelerated by learning from the vast and valuable experiences gained from the operation of the AC power grids for more than a century. This paper introduces concept of flexible DC transmission system (FDCTS), inspired by the successful operation of flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS), to provide voltage regulation, power control and load flow control within MTDC grids. Considering the current advancements in the field of power electronics, this paper recognizes DC-DC converters as the first element of the FDTCS for providing voltage and power control in MTDC grids. By use of DC-DC converters, this paper developes two elements of the FDCTS, namely the cascaded power flow controller (CPFC) and hybrid power flow controller (HPFC). In this paper, to demonstrate the eligibility of the CPFC and HPFC to play the role of an FDCTS, they are included in the DC power flow formulation for DC voltage regulation and power flow control purposes.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016. One of the main problems that need to be solved to allow the realisation of multi-terminal high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission systems is the absence of a practical power flow control method. Industry leaders and researchers have proposed a few methods of power flow control based on either the control of converter station or the connection of new power electronic equipment to the grid. This study presents the operation and control of a three-port insulated gate bipolar transistor-based current flow control (CFC) device suitable for multi-terminal HVDC systems. Key features and functionalities of the proposed controller including the balancing of cable currents, limiting the magnitude of cable current and current nulling are demonstrated. The three-port CFC was simulated using power system computer aided design (PSCAD)/electromagnetic transient and direct current (EMTDC), network simulation software to evaluate its steady state and dynamic performance. Furthermore, low-power prototypes are implemented for a two and three-ports CFC to experimentally validate their different functionalities. Simulation and experimental studies explore the fast dynamic response and the results show that the CFC studied may have a significant role to play in the control of power flows in multi-terminal high-voltage DC systems.},

abstract = {Recent interests in developing a new type of grid have suggested the idea of the dc grid. However, the dc grid has less degrees of freedom than an ac grid which restricts its power flow control ability. To overcome this situation, an auxiliary dc voltage controller that would vary the voltage on a dc line can be inserted to provide additional degrees of control freedom. This paper investigates the benefits of adding such controller on a dc grid. The region of operation for a system with and without the auxiliary dc voltage controller is calculated. Two configurations are studied: a 3 terminals system with 3 lines and a 4 terminals system with 5 lines. The analysis confirms the enlargement of the region of operation for both systems and high sensitivity to voltage variations caused by the controller is explored.},

@inproceedings{Balasubramaniam2015,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.In recent years, the demand for HVDC grids has greatly increased due to the integration of renewable energy, especially offshore wind energy. The current flow within the DC grid is passively determined by the resistance of the DC lines. In a complex DC grid, the current flow in each cable cannot be precisely controlled by adjusting the voltage set points of each converter and an overload may occur. In order to improve the efficiency of the branch utilization and the reliability of the grid, the current flow has to be rescheduled between DC nodes. This can be achieved by introducing a series current flow controller (CFC). This paper discusses the operation and control of a dual H-bridge CFC on a meshed connected DC grid. Two different strategies have been proposed to control the CFC, namely, master-slave control and single modulation control. A four-terminal DC grid has been modelled in Simulink/ SimPowerSystems to analyse the dynamic performance of the CFC under the proposed control strategies and a DC fault. The strategies have been compared in terms of system power losses. In addition, the operation and control of a reduced IGBT-based CFC is presented.},

To do so, appropriate static power injection models of the PFCs are obtained. Accordingly, sensitivity relationships between the defined power performance index and each PFCs control variable are obtained. It is for the optimal PFCs placement purpose in order to utilize maximum capacities of the transmission grid. Optimal settings for the PFC as well as the controllable voltage source converters are computed in turn by applying sequential quadratic programming solver to the developed security-based DC optimal power-flow problem which includes several corrective constraints. The study scope is single contingencies affecting HVDC lines with the objective of eliminating the consequent overloaded HVDC lines and thereby enhancing the MT-HVDC grid security by controlling the power flows within the MT-HVDC grid. Static simulations are performed considering two generic four-terminal and eighth-terminal MT-HVDC test grids in order to demonstrate the proposed methods effectiveness and authenticate its robustness. The obtained results indicate that the MT-HVDC grid can remain secure under single HVDC line contingencies in most cases by implementing the proposed method.},

This study focuses on behavior of interline H-bridge CFC in a DC grid in fault condition. In addition to the CFC circuit level fault studies, non-linear and linearized simplified models are developed for system level analysis. The analysis and fault study shows that the interline H-bridge CFC cannot survive during DC transmission line and bus faults due to an overvoltage occurring in its capacitor. Further investigation figures out that this overvoltage cannot be avoided even in presence of fast HVDC circuit breakers. Hence, an improved control system together with circuit level modifications are proposed to improve the CFC post-fault operation and to retain its components from possible damages.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Increased penetration of offshore wind power plants (OWPPs) demands frequency control services from them. Overloading the wind turbine, for few seconds after the under frequency event, to utilize its kinetic energy seems promising option for fast primary frequency control. Two methods of overloading the wind turbine (WT), with and without considering the impact of WT dynamics and variation of WT output power during the overload, are proposed in the literature. In this paper, these two methods are applied for fast primary frequency control from OWPPs connected through multi-terminal DC grid considering the operation of the WT at below rated wind speed. Moreover, the impact of release of overload on the dynamics of the wind turbine, therefore on the associated AC and DC grids are studied in this paper. Finally, the suitable overloading method is proposed based on the simulation and experimental results. The time domain simulations for fast primary frequency control are performed on an OWPP connected through a 3-terminal DC grid using DIgSILENT PowerFactory. The experiments are performed on OWPP model integrated to a laboratory scale 3-terminal DC grid test set up. Based on the simulations and experimental results, overloading method which considers the variation of WT output power during the overload provides better performance during and after release of the overload.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd This study focuses on the operation and control of HVDC multi-terminal systems that transmit the power being generated in offshore wind farms to the terrestrial AC grids. The aim of the paper is to propose and validate an algorithm to ensure optimal operation of HVDC-HVAC systems. This algorithm is implemented in a central controller that, knowing the electrical characteristics of the DC and AC systems, the power generation from the wind farms and the power demand, executes periodically an AC/DC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) and sends the appropriate voltage references to the grid side converter's control. The voltage control of the DC grid is distributed and based on droop law, implemented in grid side converters. The droop offset is modified periodically so as to adapt to the actual operating conditions and ensure optimal operation according to a specified objective function. Dynamic simulations show the system optimal operation in terms of loss minimization under wind speed changes, loss of communications and demand variation. These results are validated experimentally after implementing the control scheme in an HVDC scaled experimental platform. Dynamic simulations are also performed to show that the system can still be operated based on the proposed strategy even during contingencies implying the disconnection of a power system element (converter and DC cable).},

This work addresses the concept of connecting wind power plants in series with an LCC-HVDC transmission link already built by means of a self-commutating Current Source Converter (CSC). The idea is similar to series tapping stations which can extract power form the HVDC link. Nevertheless, a CSC can act as a rectifier or inverter, so power reversal is available and has the same advantages of a VSC. The coupling between LCC stations and the CSC is straightforward since both topologies are current source converters.

This concept allows to use simplified DCFC devices to prevent the overloads, with a reduction of the required CFC voltage compared with a single CFC in the grid. First, a methodology to investigate the effect of installing DCFCs in a generic meshed HVDC grid is presented.

Then, this work analyses the increase in the operational area brought by installing DCFCs in a 3-terminal HVDC grid and it is compared with the increase achieved by a Dual H-bridge CFC in one node. The CFC losses and voltage requirement depending on the location of the DCFCs are investigated. Finally, the operation and control of the DCFCs are designed and tested in a 3-terminal meshed HVDC grid using dynamic simulations.},

The tapping station allows to integrate wind power resources without building a new HVDC link and it is based on a Current Source Converter (CSC). However, the CSC requires a minimum DC current to extract the power coming from the OWPP which may not be guaranteed depending on the power conditions of the HVDC corridor.

A power reduction algorithm is presented to limit power extraction during a reduction in the current of the HVDC transmission system and under loss of communications between the CSC and the OWPP.

Its key features include: 1) simpler circuit topology, 2) fewer components and 3) elimination of external power supply and low-frequency high-voltage-insulation isolated transformer. A three-terminal HVDC system including the dc power flow controller is studied and its operation principle and characteristics are analyzed. A simulation mode is built to test the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed dc power flow controller with cases of power injection step down, power loss of one terminal and power flow reversal. A three-terminal dc system is built in the lab to validate the dc power flow controller. The results show that the proposed dc power flow controller can enhance the performance and controllability of a multi-terminal HVDC system.???},

abstract = {This paper proposes the design of a novel DC current flow controller (CFC) and evaluates the control performance of balancing and regulating the DC branch currents using the DC CFC in a meshed multi-terminal HVDC (MTDC) grid. The DC CFC consists of two identical full bridge DC-DC converters with the capacitors of the two converters being connected in parallel. The scalability of the DC CFC is easily achievable due to the identical bridge converter topology; the cost of this DC CFC is also relatively low due to its simple physical structure and low voltage ratings. The control performance of the DC CFC is tested on a meshed 3-terminal (3-T) HVDC grid, which is based on modular multilevel converters (MMC). The DC branch current control in the meshed MTDC grid is achieved using the proposed control strategy of the DC CFC, and is verified through case studies on the real-time digital simulator (RTDS).},

abstract = {Increased offshore wind penetration has raised the need of multi-terminal high-voltage direct-current (MTDC) grids. An MTDC system will enable cross-border energy exchange where the excessive energy can be transferred between countries, increasing the functionality and reliability of the network. However, as the number of terminals and branches increases, power flow management becomes a challenge. To improve reliability and efficiency, power flow needs to be rescheduled between terminals. This can be achieved by introducing a power flow controller (PFC). In this paper, an insulated-gate bipolar transistor based series PFC is proposed. A PFC is basically a low power rated controllable voltage source connected in series with a DC line. It enables the regulation of grid power flow via a small series voltage injection. A four-terminal MTDC system is modelled using Simulink/ SimPowerSystems to test the impact of the proposed device. This is analysed under two different control strategies for the voltage source converter-based terminals; namely, master-slave and voltage droop control. Simulation results show that the PFC is capable of enhancing the system performance by suitably redirecting the power flow at the point of connection. Moreover, the results clearly illustrate that the converter control modes effectively affect the power flow in the MTDC grid.},

abstract = {The current-carrying capability of dc lines is limited by their thermal and electric stress limits. Thus, the line current must be maintained within the permissible operational region to protect the lines from damage. In a dense dc grid, control over each line current cannot be achieved without including additional control devices. In this paper, a dual H-bridge current flow controller (2B-CFC) is used to manage the dc grid line power flow by providing dc voltage compensation in series with dc lines. A centralized hierarchical control system is proposed to coordinate the operation between multiple CFCs. A novel voltage-sharing control scheme is demonstrated. It is shown that such a scheme reduces the workload on a single CFC by sharing the required control voltage between multiple CFCs, and, in addition, can be used to avoid control conflicts among active CFCs during communication failure. An experimental platform consisting of a three-terminal dc grid and small-scale 2B-CFC prototypes has been developed to validate the concepts. For completeness, the CFC performance has been analyzed for overload conditions and when no communication exists. Small-scale dc circuit breakers have been developed to study the CFC performance under a pole-to-pole fault. {\textcopyright} 1986-2012 IEEE.},

This type of generator has three different three-phase stators sharing the same machine yoke and connected to the grid by means of three dif- ferent voltage source back-to-back power converters. Due to the machine configuration, magnetic couplings are present between the three stators, complicating the design and implementation of themachine current controllers. Rather than a centralized control approach, this paper proposes a methodology to design a decen- tralized machine control to regulate the active and reactive power flowing through each stator independently. A complete dynamic analysis is performed in order to design the controller to reduce the coupling effects within the machine, while ensuring a proper dynamic performance.
